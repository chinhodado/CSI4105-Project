# CSI4105-Project

### Minimum feedback vertex set problem

This project explores the following algorithms:

 - Bruteforce
 - Bruteforce-cycle
 - Iterative Compression (optimization version)
 - Maximum Induced Forest

A randomized algorithm was also implemented, but it is horribly slow, so don't use it, unless you want to make bruteforce looks better.

Require the NetworkX library.
